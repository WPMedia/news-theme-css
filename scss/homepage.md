# Theme CSS
## Overview
This is the CSS framework for the Fusion News Theme.

### Usage as a dependency:
1. Import as an NPM dependency in your blocks repo.
2. Set the following in the feature pack's blocks.json:
    `"cssImport": "~@wpmedia/news-theme-css/scss/index",` 
    Fusion will then inject this import into all your block's scss
    files...so you do not need to import it.
